# Course Project: Electricity Price Explanation 

## Repository Description :
- `dataset` folder contains all datasets to fit the models, including the preprocessed ones
- `notebooks (root)` folder contains the notebook for preprocessing and analyzing the data
- `notebooks/predicting_models` folder contains the models used for prediction. More precisely, there is a notebook with a benchmark of some simple models, then one notebook for each advanced model.
- `results` folder contains all csv results files to be submitted.
- `presentation` folder contains our report
- `provided materials` contains the initial notebooks provided by QRT
  
## Abstract
Every day, a multitude of factors impact the price of electricity. This chal-
lenge aims to model the electricity price from weather, energy, and commercial
data for two European countries - France and Germany. It is not a prediction
problem, but an explanatory one, to understand the daily price variation of
electricity futures contracts.

## Challenge Goals
The goal is to learn a model that outputs from these explanatory variables a
good estimation for the daily price variation of electricity futures contracts in
France and Germany.
