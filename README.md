# Course Project: Electricity Price Explanation 

## Abstract
Every day, a multitude of factors impact the price of electricity. This chal-
lenge aims to model the electricity price from weather, energy, and commercial
data for two European countries - France and Germany. It is not a prediction
problem, but an explanatory one, to understand the daily price variation of
electricity futures contracts.

## Challenge Goals
The goal is to learn a model that outputs from these explanatory variables a
good estimation for the daily price variation of electricity futures contracts in
France and Germany.
